# Getting Started with Game Development

Game development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're interested in creating indie games or working at a major studio, understanding the fundamentals is crucial.

## Key Concepts

### Game Loops
Every game runs on a loop that handles input, updates game state, and renders graphics. Understanding this cycle is fundamental to game programming.

### Entity-Component Systems
Modern game engines often use ECS architecture to manage game objects efficiently. This pattern separates data (components) from behavior (systems).

### Physics and Collision
Games need to simulate real-world physics. Learning about collision detection, rigid bodies, and physics engines will serve you well.

## Getting Started

1. Choose a game engine (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
2. Learn the basics of programming
3. Start with small projects
4. Join game development communities
5. Practice, practice, practice

The journey of a thousand games begins with a single sprite.
